# PhoneGap Template

This application is an HTML5/CSS/Javascript web application built with the Adobe PhoneGap framework for Android and iOS devices. 

The goal of this application is to make for an easy to use, web based mobile app development framework.

## Development Environment

The development environment of this application is Apache Cordova / PhoneGap, and is intended to work easily with the PhoneGap online build system.

### Requirements

* Node.js
* Cordova CLI
* Android SDK (For local testing on Android)
* PhoneGap Build Account (Optional)

## Client Libraries

The following client libraries are used to facilitate the end user experience of the mobile application.

* Bootstrap 4.1.0
* Popper.js
* jQuery 3.3.1
* Font Awesome Icons
* Google Roboto Font

## How-To

The documentation is currently in the code, the pages are commented and it should be easy to follow for most web developers.

## Testing

This template is designed in a way that it can be tested in a browser without any cordova/phonegap, android, or ios emulators installed. Simply open /www/index.html in Firefox (Chrome will fail due to CORS issues) and browse the page locally.  You may also server from a web server.  Any mobile application specific code and plugins added will fail to work from the PC browser.
